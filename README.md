# Personal Website
My name is Jerlson Sik and was currently a college student who studied in United States. I am taking my degree in Computer and Information Technology at Purdue University. I would like to proceed my career in Computer related field especially in building website and integrating some future technologies such as AI and Web3.0. 

## About My Personal Website:
I created this website for two purposes. 
- Introduce myself to people so that they could know me quickly and comprehensively by just looking into my website.
- Learning new technologies and sharpened my web developing skills by creating a website of my own.

## What I learned:
- **Web Programming**: I learned about different technologies which I didn't use before like Angular, TypeScript, BootStrap, Sass, Azure etc.
- **Azure**: Deploying my angular application into azure server.
